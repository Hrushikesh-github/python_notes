Replace All:
  :%s/foo/bar/g
Find each occurrence of 'foo' (in all lines), and replace it with 'bar'.
For specific lines:
:6,10s/foo/bar/g
Change each 'foo' to 'bar' for all lines from line 6 to line 10 inclusive.


When inside vim,
:tabnew filename
Or frin terminal vim -p file1 file2

:Explore opens the file explorer window
In normal mode, :e + Ctrl-Shift-D also works(press escape to leave)
or :Explore but this actually replaces the current file in case u choose
a new file
